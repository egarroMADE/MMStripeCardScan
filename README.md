## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

MMStripeCardScan 1.5.0 only works on iOS14, and MMStripeCardScan 1.3.0 only works on iOS13! They can be included on projects whose deployment target is iOS12, but it won't work. 
Such projects must use conditional directives `if #available(iOS 13,*)` and find other alternatives such as Card.IO to support iOS12.

## Installation

MMStripeCardScan is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'MMStripeCardScan'
```
